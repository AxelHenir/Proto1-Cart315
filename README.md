# Prototype 1

Game Testing Hypothesis:

I want to try making a parkouring game where the player has a grappling hook. I envision a puzzle platformer with physics similar to what is found in portal. I want to explore the space of high-speed action puzzle platforming!

In this prototype, I implemented a custom player controller and a grappling hook mechanic. Before I begin designing puzzles and levels, my goal is to find a peaceful center with the physics of the game.

In this playtest, I want to understand the flaws and strengths of my physics engine. I want to know if players feel comfortable navigating my level with the current implementation of the grappling hook and movement mechanics. Will players like it? Will the rhythm of swinging come naturally? Will players explore the interactions of sprinting, reeling in, and detaching to gain huge bursts of speed?





# Week 1 Gametesting results

I was absent in class for playtests but I made a build and let me friends try it out. 

Notable commentary:
"I feel like I'm in slow motion"
"I like the floating text"
"So it's like spiderman?"

What worked:
The basic mechanics and the introduction of the controls were the highlights of the playtest. My testers liked swinging around but oftne mentioned that it felt slow and lethargic. If I were to continue with development on this prototype, I would likely try playing around with the physics and the camera to make the game feel  faster paced and better framed for that fast motion. Perhaps a third person camera?
