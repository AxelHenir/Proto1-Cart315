# Prototype 1

Game Testing Hypothesis:

I want to try making a parkouring game where the player has a grappling hook. I envision a puzzle platformer with physics similar to what is found in portal. I want to explore the space of high-speed action puzzle platforming!

In this prototype, I implemented a custom player controller and a grappling hook mechanic. Before I begin designing puzzles and levels, my goal is to find a peaceful center with the physics of the game.

In this playtest, I want to understand the flaws and strengths of my physics engine. I want to know if players feel comfortable navigating my level with the current implementation of the grappling hook and movement mechanics. Will players like it? Will the rhythm of swinging come naturally? Will players explore the interactions of sprinting, reeling in, and detaching to gain huge bursts of speed?
